\title{Generalized Pareto/NBD Probability Mass Function}
\usage{
pnbd.pmf.General(params, t.start, t.end, x, hardie)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{Pareto/NBD parameters - a vector with r, alpha, s, and beta, in
that order. r and alpha are unobserved parameters for the NBD transaction
process. s and beta are unobserved parameters for the Pareto (exponential
gamma) dropout process.}

\item{t.start}{start of time period for which probability is being
calculated. It can also be a vector of values.}

\item{t.end}{end of time period for which probability is being calculated. It
can also be a vector of values.}

\item{x}{number of repeat transactions by a random customer in the period
defined by (t.start, t.end]. It can also be a vector of values.}

\item{hardie}{if TRUE, use \code{\link{h2f1}} instead of
\code{\link[hypergeo]{hypergeo}}.}
}
\value{
Probability of x transaction occuring between t.start and t.end
conditional on model parameters. If t.start, t.end, and/or x has a length
greater than one, a vector of probabilities will be returned.
}
\description{
Generalized probability mass function for the Pareto/NBD.
}
\details{
P(X(t.start, t.end)=x | r, alpha, s, beta). Returns the probability that a
customer makes x repeat transactions in the time interval (t.start, t.end].

It is impossible for a customer to make a negative number of repeat
transactions. This function will return an error if it is given negative
times or a negative number of repeat transactions. This function will also
return an error if t.end is less than t.start.

\code{t.start}, \code{t.end}, and \code{x} may be vectors. The standard rules
for vector operations apply - if they are not of the same length, shorter
vectors will be recycled (start over at the first element) until they are as
long as the longest vector. It is advisable to keep vectors to the same
length and to use single values for parameters that are to be the same for
all calculations. If one of these parameters has a length greater than one,
the output will be a vector of probabilities.

# probability that a customer will make 10 repeat transactions in the
# time interval (1,2]

# probability that a customer will make no repeat transactions in the
# time interval (39,78]

                 t.end = 78,
