#' 
#' This package implements the BG/BB, BG/NBD and Pareto/NBD models, which
#' capture/project customer purchase patterns in a typical
#' non-contractual setting.
#' 
#' While these models are developed on a customer-by-customer basis, they
#' do not necessarily require data at such a granular level. The
#' Pareto/NBD requires a "customer-by-sufficient-statistic" matrix
#' (CBS), which consists of each customer's frequency, recency (the time
#' of their last transactions) and total time observed - but the timing
#' of each and every transaction (other than the last) is not needed by
#' the model. If, however, you do have the granular data in the form of
#' an event log (which contains at least columns for customer
#' identification and the time of each transaction, and potentially more
#' columns such as transaction amount), this package provides functions
#' to convert it to a CBS. You can use \code{\link{dc.ReadLines}} to get
#' your event log from a comma-delimited file to an event log usable by
#' this package; it is possible to use read.table or read.csv, but
#' formatting will be required afterwards. You can then convert the event
#' log directly to a CBS (for both the calibration and holdout periods)
#' using \code{\link{dc.ElogToCbsCbt}}. As the name suggests, this
#' function also produces a customer-by-time matrix (CBT). This matrix
#' consists of a row for every customer and a column for every date, and
#' is populated by a statistic of your choice (reach, frequency, or
#' spend). It is not necessary for any of the models presented in this
#' package, but is used as a building block to produce the CBS.
#' 
#' The BG/NBD model requires all the same inputs as the Pareto/NBD model.
#' 
#' The BG/BB model requires the same information as the Pareto/NBD model,
#' but as it models discrete transaction opportunities, this information
#' can be condensed into a recency-frequency matrix. A recency-frequency
#' matrix contains a row for every recency/frequency combination in the
#' given time period, and each row contains the number of customers with
#' that recency/frequency combination. Since frequency will always be
#' less than or equal to recency, this matrix will contain (n)(n-1)/2 + 1
#' rows at most, with n as the number of transaction opportunities (of
#' course, the maximum number of rows for pooled data - for customers
#' with varying numbers of transaction opportunities - will be the sum of
#' the above equation for each unique number of transaction
#' opportunities). You can convert a CBS to recency-frequency matrices
#' using \code{\link{dc.MakeRFmatrixCal}} and
#' \code{\link{dc.MakeRFmatrixHoldout}}.
#' 
#' If you want to test the data contained in the package, or have data
#' formatted as a customer-by-sufficient-statistic or recency-frequency
#' matrix, a good starting place would be
#' \code{\link{pnbd.EstimateParameters}}, 
#' \code{\link{bgnbd.EstimateParameters}}, or
#' \code{\link{bgbb.EstimateParameters}}.
#' 
#' Following that, \code{\link{pnbd.PlotFrequencyInCalibration}}, 
#' \code{\link{bgnbd.PlotFrequencyInCalibration}} and
#' \code{\link{bgbb.PlotFrequencyInCalibration}} will give a check that
#' the model fits the data in-sample. Further plotting functions,
#' comparing actual and expected results, are labelled
#' "pnbd.Plot...", "bgnbd.Plot..." and "bgbb.Plot...". 
#' The building blocks of these functions are also provided: 
#' \code{\link{pnbd.LL}}, \code{\link{bgnbd.LL}}
#' \code{\link{bgbb.LL}}, \code{\link{pnbd.pmf}},
#' \code{\link{bgnbd.pmf}}, \code{\link{bgbb.pmf}},
#' \code{\link{pnbd.Expectation}}, \code{\link{bgnbd.Expectation}}, 
#' \code{\link{bgbb.Expectation}}, 
#' \code{\link{pnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions}}, 
#' \code{\link{bgnbd.ConditionalExpectedTransactions}}, and
#' \code{\link{bgbb.ConditionalExpectedTransactions}} may be of
#' particular interest.
#' 
#' This package uses the following conventions:
#' 
#' The time period used to estimate the model parameters is called the
#' _calibration period_. Users may be accustomed to this being
#' called the estimation period, or simply being referred to as
#' "in-sample". Function parameter names generally follow this
#' convention: for example, "n.cal" is used to refer to the number
#' of transaction opportunities in the calibration period.
#' 
#' The time period used to validate model performance is called the
#' _holdout period_. Users may be accustomed to this being called
#' the validation period, or simply being referred to as
#' "out-of-sample". Function parameters relating to this time
#' period are generally appended with ".star". For example, n.star
#' is used to refer to the number of transaction opportunities in the
#' holdout period.
#' 
#' As described in the papers referenced below, the BG/BB, BG/NBD and 
#' Pareto/NBD   models are generally concerned with repeat transactions, 
#' not total transactions. This means that a customer's first transaction 
#' in the   calibration period is usually not part of the data being 
#' modeled - this is due to the fact that a new customer generally does 
#' not show up "on the company's radar" until after their first 
#' purchase has taken place. This means that the modal number of repeat 
#' purchases tends to be zero. If your data does not have a relatively large 
#' number of customers with zero transactions, but does have a relatively large
#' number of customers with one transaction, and the estimation functions
#' are struggling, the problem is most likely that you are including
#' customers' very first transactions. Some of the data-conversion
#' functions have examples illustrating how to work with data that
#' includes this very first transaction. Note that this does not apply to
#' the holdout period; in the holdout period, we already know about the
#' customer and take all of their previous transactions into account.
